# About Me

I am currently undertaking a 4-month course in data analysis funded by a competitive scholarship awarded by the UK Department of Education, with the goal of using my knowledge of human behaviour and data analysis to contribute to the effectiveness of organisations whose goal is to improve human or animal welfare in the near- or long-term future.
